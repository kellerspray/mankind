Chapter 1: The Scurrying Witness
The air was thick with the musk of polished leather and stale cologne, a miasma that clung to the nostrils of the tiny creature skittering beneath the floorboards. Hell Hitler, bound to the sensory prison of a common house mouse, twitched his whiskers, parsing the chemical signatures of the room above. His host’s olfactory bulb, wired for survival, relayed a flood of data: the acrid tang of ink on fresh documents, the sour whiff of sweat from a pacing figure, and the faint, sweet decay of overripe fruit left on a mahogany desk. The mouse’s brain, a mere 0.4 grams of neural tissue, processed these inputs with primal urgency, but the consciousness tethered to it—his consciousness—carried the weight of a century’s atrocities, now forced to observe anew.
The room vibrated with the cadence of a voice, brash and unyielding, its timbre slicing through the wooden slats. Hell Hitler, lacking human ears, relied on the mouse’s acute auditory cortex, tuned to frequencies between 1 and 100 kHz. The words were muffled, filtered through the rodent’s sensory bias, but their rhythm was unmistakable—a staccato of self-assured proclamations, punctuated by the occasional thump of a fist on the desk. The mouse, driven by instinct, darted toward a crack in the baseboard, its vibrissae brushing against the splintered wood. Through the slit, Hell Hitler glimpsed a sliver of the scene: polished shoes pacing, a garish red tie swinging like a pendulum, and the glint of a gold-plated pen catching the chandelier’s light.
This was the first moment of his eternal sentence, a punishment rooted in the logic of enforced empathy. Neuroscience posited that prolonged exposure to another’s perspective could rewire moral frameworks—mirror neurons firing, oxytocin pathways strengthening. Here, the mechanism was crueler: his mind, intact with its catalog of horrors, was shackled to a creature incapable of abstract thought, forcing him to piece together meaning from sensory fragments. The mouse’s eyes, optimized for low-light detection, offered a fisheye view of the room, distorted and grainy. Yet the figure at the desk, barking orders into a phone, was unmistakable. The man’s gestures—expansive, commanding—mirrored the oratory flourishes Hell Hitler once wielded. The irony burned deeper than any flame.
A second voice entered, smoother, deferential, yet laced with ambition. The mouse’s ears twitched, pinpointing the source: a younger man, lean and sharp-eyed, stepping into the room. Hell Hitler’s host froze, whiskers quivering, as the new figure’s boots thudded closer. Through the mouse’s lateral geniculate nucleus, he registered the man’s tailored suit, the calculated tilt of his head—Pokey Vance-JDansky, the opportunist, whose every syllable dripped with calculated loyalty. The mouse’s heart rate spiked, its amygdala signaling danger, but Hell Hitler’s mind dissected the scene with cold precision. This was no mere lackey; this was a man sculpting his own ascent, each word a brick laid on the path to power.
The desk-man’s voice rose, a tirade about “weakness” and “enemies,” words that resonated with Hell Hitler’s own lexicon of hate. The mouse, oblivious to meaning, scurried toward a crumb near the desk leg, its olfactory receptors locking onto the starch. Hell Hitler, however, was trapped in the subtext: the desk-man’s rhetoric, though cloaked in modern vernacular, echoed the same divisive cadence he once perfected. The realization was a synaptic jolt, forcing him to confront the persistence of his own legacy in this hypothetical future. The mouse gnawed the crumb, its incisors grinding, while Hell Hitler’s mind churned, cataloging every gesture, every inflection, as if etching them into his eternal memory.
A sudden clatter—a pen dropped—sent the mouse bolting back to the crack. Through its monocular vision, Hell Hitler caught fragmented glimpses: a map unfurled on the desk, red lines slashing across borders, and a third figure entering, his posture rigid with defiance. Zelenzky³Hero, his presence a counterpoint to the room’s bombast, spoke in measured tones, his words lost to the mouse’s auditory range but carrying a weight that stilled the air. The mouse’s instincts screamed retreat, but Hell Hitler’s consciousness lingered, piecing together the tableau: a clash of wills, a microcosm of resistance against tyranny.
As the mouse vanished into the shadows, Hell Hitler’s mind burned with the burden of observation. Each second, each sensory input, was a lesson he could not escape—a forced reckoning with the world he once shaped, now refracted through the humblest of creatures. The chapter of his vigil had begun, and eternity stretched before him, unyielding.

The mouse’s claws scraped against the damp underbelly of the floorboards, its olfactory receptors flooded with the musty tang of mold and dust. Hell Hitler, chained to this rodent’s sensory prison, sifted through the chemical noise: faint traces of cigar smoke, the metallic bite of ink, and the lingering sweetness of spilled wine. The mouse’s brain, a mere flicker of instinct, chased survival, but his consciousness—laden with a century’s guilt—parsed every scent as a thread in the tapestry of power above. The room’s vibrations carried voices, their cadence sharp through the mouse’s auditory cortex, tuned to catch the faintest rustle of threat.
Through a splintered gap, Hell Hitler glimpsed the scene unfolding. The desk-man’s hands, broad and gesticulating, swept across the map, his voice a low growl about “strength” and “legacy.” The mouse’s monocular vision warped the image—fragmented, like a kaleidoscope of flesh and fabric—but the intent was clear: a performance of dominance, familiar as his own past rallies. The rodent’s whiskers twitched, sensing air currents from pacing boots, while Hell Hitler’s mind cataloged the rhetoric, each word a mirror to his own venomous orations, now cloaked in modern bravado.
Pokey Vance-JDansky lingered near the desk, his posture a study in calculated deference. The mouse’s ears, sensitive to ultrasonic squeaks, caught the younger man’s measured replies—oiled words, slick with ambition. Hell Hitler recognized the type: a sycophant weaving loyalty into a ladder for ascent. The mouse, oblivious, darted toward a speck of dried cheese, its olfactory bulb firing with primal need. But Hell Hitler’s consciousness lingered on Pokey’s micro-expressions—tightened lips, a fleeting smirk—betraying a hunger that rivaled the desk-man’s own.
Zelenzky³Hero stood resolute, his voice cutting through the din, though the mouse’s auditory range garbled the words into a rhythmic hum. The rodent’s lateral geniculate nucleus relayed a distorted glimpse: broad shoulders, a clenched jaw, eyes burning with defiance. Hell Hitler, trapped in the mouse’s sensory limits, pieced together the man’s intent—a bulwark against the desk-man’s bluster, rooted in a moral clarity he once sought to crush. The mouse froze, its amygdala flaring at a sudden stomp, but Hell Hitler’s mind churned, mapping the clash to historical echoes of resistance.
A new scent intruded—sweat and fear—heralding three figures at the room’s edge: Zonky, Fonky, and The Bürger in Fear. The mouse’s nose twitched, parsing their nervous pheromones, while Hell Hitler’s mind reconstructed their roles: citizens caught in the gears of power, their anxiety a universal signal of societal strain. The rodent scurried back to its crevice, heart pounding, but Hell Hitler’s eternal vigil held firm, each sensory fragment a lesson in the persistence of tyranny’s shadow.

The mouse’s whiskers brushed cold plaster, its olfactory neurons firing at the sharp tang of cigar ash and polished wood. Hell Hitler, bound to this rodent’s sensory cage, decoded the chemical flood: stale coffee, a whiff of gun oil, and the sour edge of human stress. The mouse’s tiny brain chased survival, but his consciousness, heavy with historical sin, sifted each scent for meaning. Vibrations pulsed through the floor—a heated exchange above, the desk-man’s voice booming, its cadence sharp in the mouse’s ears, tuned to 1–100 kHz frequencies.

Through a jagged floorboard slit, Hell Hitler’s host glimpsed movement: the desk-man’s fist slamming down, maps fluttering. The mouse’s vision, grainy and wide-angled, caught the red tie’s swing, a garish pendulum of power. The rhetoric—calls for “loyalty” and “purge”—echoed Hell Hitler’s own past venom, now repackaged in modern bluster. The mouse skittered toward a crumb, its incisors clicking, but Hell Hitler’s mind lingered, dissecting the scene’s familiarity, a neuroplastic reminder of his own crafted chaos.

Pokey Vance-JDansky’s voice slithered in, smooth yet edged with hunger. The mouse’s ears twitched, catching the calculated deference, each word a step toward influence. Hell Hitler, through the rodent’s fragmented sight, noted Pokey’s clenched jaw, a flicker of ambition betraying his mask. The mouse’s amygdala flared at a sudden shout, but Hell Hitler’s eternal mind cataloged the dynamic: a sycophant’s dance, mirroring his own lieutenants’ old betrayals.

Zelenzky³Hero countered, his tone steady, words muffled but resolute through the mouse’s auditory filter. The rodent’s eyes glimpsed a defiant stance, a moral anchor amidst the storm. Hell Hitler, trapped in sensory scraps, recognized the resistance—unyielding, like those he once crushed. The mouse darted back, heart racing, as new figures emerged: Zonky, Fonky, and The Bürger in Fear, their anxious breaths spiking the air with panic’s chemical signature.

A distant hum grew—#NAFO’s digital whispers, unseen but felt, a collective pulse of defiance. The mouse froze, whiskers quivering, as Hell Hitler’s mind grappled with the tension: power’s weight versus resistance’s spark, a clash etched in every sensory pulse, building toward a reckoning over ten pages of relentless observation.
