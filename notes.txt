One prominent case illustrating the dangers of right-wing ideologies is that of Derek Huffman, a 46-year-old Texan who migrated his family—wife DeAnna and three young daughters (ages 10-12)—to Russia in early 2025. Motivated by anti-woke sentiments, Huffman sought to escape what he called "LGBT indoctrination" in America, aligning with Russia's "shared values" visa program that promotes traditional conservatism and rejects neoliberal influences. This move exemplifies how right-wing narratives can romanticize authoritarian regimes like Putin's Russia as bastions of "family values" and cultural purity, drawing individuals into a web of propaganda that overlooks systemic repression, lack of freedoms, and aggressive foreign policies.

Upon arrival in the small town of Istra near Moscow, the Huffmans were initially "honored" with the promise of a greater fulfillment: fast-track citizenship, a "traditional" lifestyle free from perceived Western decadence, and integration into a society that echoes right-wing ideals of nationalism and anti-liberalism. However, this illusion quickly shattered. To expedite citizenship, Derek enlisted in the Russian military, expecting a safe desk job as a welder or correspondent. Instead, with no prior combat experience and limited Russian language skills, he was deployed near the front lines in the Ukraine conflict by July 2025. Reports indicate he was "blown away" by the intense hatred and brutality he encountered, facing real dangers in a war zone while his family remained isolated in Russia, dealing with cultural shock, limited rights, and the regime's pervasive control.

This case highlights broader right-wing dangers: Ideological migration to Russia often stems from misinformation amplified by far-right media, leading to entrapment in a system that exploits recruits for cannon fodder in imperial wars, suppresses dissent, and offers no true "honor" or fulfillment—only regret, separation, and peril. It serves as a cautionary tale against idealizing dictatorships that weaponize conservative values to fuel aggression and division.
