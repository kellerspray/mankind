# Mankind needs love, food, shelter and a plan. 
Let`s start with the plan.

Authors note: 

Current state v0.0.1 involves a quite random idea of a ~52y human with a productive live, children, fullfilling marriage, commitment and contribution to a society of free choice on life and a fair relation of most people not riddled by greed.

We, the #people of the world, rise in 2025 as one unbreakable force, no longer silenced by the chains of corruption, inequality, and elite control that have ravaged our communities and planet for too long. 

 We demand an end to the madness perpetuated by a small group of powerful few who hoard wealth while millions suffer in poverty, war, and environmental devastation—from the streets of Gaza and Ukraine to the forgotten corners of Sudan, Congo, and our own neighborhoods. 

 No more artificial suffering, no more rigged systems where corporations profit from our pain, and governments complicit in genocide and oppression go unchecked. 

We declare that women's rights are human rights, that economic liberation is the key to true freedom, and that we will not accept another step backward in this fight. 

 From dock workers to teachers, nurses to students, tech innovators to farmers, we unite across borders, faiths, and backgrounds to strip power from the corporate supremacists who pollute our governance and normalize atrocities. 

 We reject division sown by identity rituals, tribalism, and misinformation; instead, we build genuine communities rooted in truth, accountability, and shared visions for sustainable growth. 

In this year of urgency, we mobilize for a mass redistribution of resources—taxing the ultra-rich, nationalizing essentials like energy and water, and investing in people-powered climate justice to heal our world within planetary boundaries. 

 We stand for safe, thriving societies where crime and lawlessness are met with fairness, not fear, and where every voice—especially those of the oppressed—is amplified through protests, votes, and collective action. 

 We will protect our freedoms, restore merit and justice, and prepare for the challenges of AI, robotics, and rising authoritarianism by holding leaders accountable and rebuilding from the ground up. 

This is our call: End impunity, defend humanity, and forge a future where all lives hold equal value—a free Palestine, a just Africa, an empowered America, and liberation for every corner of the globe. 

 We are the creators of wealth, the guardians of hope, and the force that will transform society. United, we cannot be divided; together, we will win.
